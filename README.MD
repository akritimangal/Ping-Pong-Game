# Ping-Pong-Game

# Overview
This is a simple implementation of a Ping Pong game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game consists of a ball and two paddles‚Äîone for the player and one for the computer. The player controls one paddle using mouse movement, while the computer-controlled paddle follows the ball's vertical position. The objective is to keep the ball bouncing between the paddles and score points by making the opponent miss the ball.
